Default keybind for attack: J

There are three scripts: PlayerAttack, AttackArea and Health

PlayerAttack: This script handles the attack press and how long the attack lasts. 
It activates the attack by activiting the AttackArea gameObject that is located on the player

AttackArea: This scripts consists of an onTrigger function that checks for colliders. 
If the thing it collides with has an "Enemy" tag (note uppercase), it then calls a method located in the health Script

Health: This scripts contains information on how much health a given object has and how to reduce it, through the damage function

In order for the attack to work, the rigidbody2D of the object hit, has its sleeping mode set to never sleep, otherwise the player has to move after each attack
