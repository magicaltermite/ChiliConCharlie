Default keybind for attack: J

There are three scripts: PlayerAttack, AttackArea and Health

PlayerAttack: This script handles the attack press and how long the attack lasts. 
It activates the attack by activiting the AttackArea gameObject that is located on the player

AttackArea: This scripts consists of an onTrigger function that checks for colliders. 
If the thing it collides with has an "Enemy" tag (note uppercase), it then calls a method located in the health Script

Health: This scripts contains information on how much health a given object has and how to reduce it, through the damage function
